![img](https://liwaiwai.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/vertex-ai.png)
In this lab, you can use Vertex AI to train and deploy a ML model.

# Overview
In this lab, you can use Vertex AI to train and deploy a ML model. It assumes that you are familiar with machine learning, even though the machine learning code for this training is provided to you. You will use datasets for dataset creation and management, and a custom model for training a Scikit Learn model. Finally, you will deploy the trained model and get online predictions. The dataset you will use for this demo is the Titanic Dataset.

# Objectives
Create a dataset for tabular data.

Create a training package with custom code using Notebooks.

Deploy the trained model and get online predictions.
