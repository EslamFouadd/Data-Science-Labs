In this notebook we'll make the jump from training locally, to do training in the cloud. We'll take advantage of [Google Cloud's AI Platform Training Service](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/).

# Overview

In this notebook we'll make the jump from training locally, to do training in the cloud. We'll take advantage of Google Cloud's Vertex AI Training Service.

# Objectives
In this lab, you will:

Learn how to organize your training code into a Python package.

Train your model using cloud infrastructure via Google Cloud Training Service.

(optional) Learn how to run your training package using Docker containers and push training Docker images on a Docker registry.
