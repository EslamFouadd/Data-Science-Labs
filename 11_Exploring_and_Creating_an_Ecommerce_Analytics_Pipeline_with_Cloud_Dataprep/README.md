In this lab we will explore the Cloud Dataprep UI to build an ecommerce transformation pipeline that will run at a scheduled interval and output results back into BigQuery.

# Overview
Cloud Dataprep by Trifacta is an intelligent data service for visually exploring, cleaning, and preparing structured and unstructured data for analysis. In this lab we will explore the Cloud Dataprep UI to build an ecommerce transformation pipeline that will run at a scheduled interval and output results back into BigQuery.

The dataset we will be using is an ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into BigQuery. We've made a copy of that dataset for this lab and will be exploring the available fields and rows for insights.

# Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform these tasks:

Connect BigQuery datasets to Cloud Dataprep

Explore dataset quality with Cloud Dataprep

Create a data transformation pipeline with Cloud Dataprep

Schedule transformation jobs outputs to BigQuery

# What youâ€™ll need
A Google Cloud Platform project

The Google Chrome browser. Cloud Dataprep supports only the Chrome browser.
