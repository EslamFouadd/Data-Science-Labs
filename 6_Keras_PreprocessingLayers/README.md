# Classifying Structured Data using Keras Preprocessing Layers
In this lab, you learn how to classify structured data (e.g. tabular data in a CSV). You will use Keras to define the model, and preprocessing layers as a bridge to map from columns in a CSV to features used to train the model.

# Overview
In this lab, you learn how to classify structured data (e.g. tabular data in a CSV). You use Keras to define the model, and preprocessing layers as a bridge to map from columns in a CSV to features used to train the model.

# Learning objectives
Load a CSV file using Pandas.

Build an input pipeline to batch and shuffle the rows using tf.data.

Map from columns in the CSV to features used to train the model using Keras preprocessing layers.

Build, train, and evaluate a model using Keras.
