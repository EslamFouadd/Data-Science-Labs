# Overview
In this lab, we will build a Keras DNN to predict the fare amount for NYC taxi cab rides.

# Objectives
In this lab, you will:

Review how to read in CSV file data using tf.data

Specify input, hidden, and output layers in the DNN architecture

Review and visualize the final DNN shape

Train the model locally and visualize the loss curves

Deploy and predict with the model using Cloud AI Platform
